Our practical TDD workshop offers a unique learning experience for individuals seeking to grasp the intricacies of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and pair programming. Participants, regardless of their expertise, will engage in hands-on exercises, emphasizing comprehension over completion. The workshop will cover a conceptual foundation. Participants receive a thorough introduction to essential concepts, including Pair/Mob Programming, pairing styles, the TDD Cycle, "Fake it till you make it," the "Rule of three repetitions," and "Mock it if you own it." 

We will engage in collaborative learning. Attendees form pairs or mobs, fostering diverse perspectives for enriching the learning process. We will address practical challenges. Through problem-solving, participants apply TDD principles to coding exercises, gaining practical insights. There will be an exchange of knowledge; sessions conclude with participants sharing solutions and experiences, enhancing collective learning. Upon completion, participants leave with a robust understanding of TDD and pair programming best practices. This workshop's hands-on approach and knowledge sharing empower individuals to elevate their software development skills. Join us for an immersive learning experience that brings TDD and pair programming to life.
