Inspired by PHPUnit, Jest, and others, bashunit is a testing framework for bash scripts. Every developer, at some point, has needed to make a bash script, even the scripts in our pipelines. Now you can write automated tests for them. However, this talk is not simply about bash but about building up a project with standards, strong documentation, and an open roadmap, always keeping quality in mind. We can go from a simple function to an entire OSS project in weeks, thanks to the power of disinterested collaboration.
