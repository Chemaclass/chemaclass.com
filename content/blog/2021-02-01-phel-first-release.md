The new FP language build-in PHP. Check it out!

# The Phel Language

Phel is a Functional Programming ([FP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)) language that compiles to PHP. It is a dialect of [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) inspired by Clojure and Janet.

## Features

- Built on PHP's ecosystem
- Good error reporting
- Different Datastructures (Arrays, Tables, and Tuples)
- Macros
- Recursive functions
- Powerful but simple Syntax
- REPL

## Why Phel?

Phel is a creation of Jens Haase, and as he mentions on the website, "it is the result of many [failed attempts to do functional programming in PHP](https://phel-lang.org/blog/functional-programming-in-php)". He was looking for something with these characteristics:

- A LISP-inspired
- Functional Programming language
- That runs on cheap hosting providers
- It is easy to write and debug

From my point, it was ending May 2020 when I finished the
book [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](/readings/7-languages-in-7-weeks/), in which I learned a bit of Prolog, Erlang,
Clojure, Haskellâ€¦ I even created a [repository in GitHub](https://github.com/Chemaclass/7LangIn7Weeks) to store my
progress over the weeks with these learnings.

Suddenly, one day beginning of June 2020, I saw a post in Reddit's PHP official channel, with a message of someone
mentioning this "**Phel**" project, claiming to be a **"functional programming language" written in PHP**!

I work with PHP for around 8 years so far, and I always try to combine OOP with FP as much as possible (because I
believe both paradigms are better combined; they are not necessarily exclusive), and a new dialect of Lisp fully written
in native **PHP 7.4** sounded really exciting. I decided to take a look at it. I wanted to see the code.

The fresh readings from [Mathias NoBack](https://twitter.com/matthiasnoback) books such
as [Object Design Style Guide](/readings/object-design-style-guide),
and [Advanced Web Application Architecture](/readings/advance-web-application-architecture/), gave me the courage to try
out what I learned and put it for real in a project. This was (and still is) a beautiful challenge, which helps me to
test myself and grow professionally at the same time.

My first commit was done on 6 June 2020, and since then I work on this project a bit (almost) every day in my free time.
It helps me to learn more about FP, languages internal design, and best practices on testing and software design
architecture in general.

I started applying minor changes until I ended refactoring the whole compiler structure (among other things) in order to
make the modules easier to read and understand. Psalm, strict types, good test coverage, unifying code styleâ€¦ These were
some of my favorite topics.

## Example of Phel code

The following example gives a short impression of how Phel looks like:
```phel
# Define a namespace
(ns my\example)
# Define a variable with name "my-name" and value "world"
(def my-name "world")
# Define a func with name "print-name" and one argument
(defn print-name [your-name]
  (print "hello" your-name))
# Call the function
(print-name my-name)
```

## Current status of Phel
- We have an open [Gitter Community](https://gitter.im/phel-lang/community) where we help each other
- We prepared an easy [Getting Started Guide](https://phel-lang.org/documentation/getting-started/)
- We prepared an easy GitHub Repository with a [Phel Scaffolding Template](https://github.com/phel-lang/phel-scaffolding)
- We just released the first official version: [0.1.0](https://github.com/phel-lang/phel-lang/tags)
