## What is Open-Source Software (OSS)? 🤔

OSS shares similarities with free software, but it's not the same. Free software is a form of OSS, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it has to be free. For example:

- [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/blob/master/LICENSE) is an example of OSS which is free.
- [Spryker](https://github.com/spryker/spryker-core/blob/master/LICENSE) is an example of OSS which is not free.

> OSS is basically software that is public, open to the world.

## Benefits — for a company 🛕

- Adoption: the easier the access, the easier the adoption.
- Training and tutorials help the system to grow.
- Tech: often on the cutting edge of technology.
  Tech moves fast. They will get obsolete if they don't.
- Community: the people around want to improve as it grows.
  Public channels enable easy access and community building.
- Trust: the software is public and accessible.
  Everyone can check the quality of the software anytime.

## Benefits — for you, as a single contributor 🤓

- Flexibility: decide on what you want to work on.
- Self-confidence: the experience improves your skills.
- Training: without the pressure of a PROD environment.
- Tech: play with the latest features of your tech.
  Try upcoming versions of your coding lang, or even try new ones!
- Soft skills: improve your communication skills.
  Good communication in the project is important.
  Especially when you face disagreements.

> TL;DR: It can be a "constant kata" if you want to.

## Github to the rescue 😃

Nowadays, it's really trivial to start contributing to OSS:
- You can start your own project. A pet project fits here perfectly!
- You can contribute to an existing OSS project.

## Pet projects 🐘

A pet project is a playground to create software and train your professional skills. Creating pet projects in your public Github profile has all the benefits of contributing to OSS, plus you're your own boss:
- You dictate the roadmap.
- You decide what to do and how.
- You're your own boss.

> The project is there for you. <br>
> You are responsible to play, explore and pass your limits.

## Some of Chema's OSS org contributions 🌚

#### Active

- [phel-lang](https://github.com/phel-lang/phel-lang): Phel is a functional programming language that compiles to PHP. It is a dialect of Lisp inspired by Clojure and Janet.
  I already wrote a post about phel-lang: [Phel: A Lisp that compiles to PHP](https://chemaclass.medium.com/phel-the-lisp-that-compiles-to-php-544980605ebe)
- [gacela-project](https://github.com/gacela-project/gacela): Gacela is a PHP framework that helps you to improve the design of your application by splitting the logic into different modules.

#### Abandoned

- nm_template: The base template for NuevaMetal (2013–2016).

## Knowledge sharing ✍🏼

- Pull Requests vs Pair Programming
- The process itself is the goal
- The art of refactoring; When, How, and Why
- The art of testing: Where design meets quality

## The beauty of this 🧑‍🎓

- Seeing the corrections that you constantly keep doing
- Seeing how your own code gets old with time
- Seeing the many mistakes that you have done
- Seeing how you are getting better at coding over time

Developing a sixth sense to smell patterns which you have already done and their positive & negative experiences.

**Showing your skills and helping the community around you.**

> Open-Source Software offers you one of the best opportunities to start building your career path towards continuous improvement.
