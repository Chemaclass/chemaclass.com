Leadership is not a synonym for management, it has nothing to do with titles or personal attributes. So, what is it? How
can we become leaders? And most importantly, why?

<!-- more -->

While researching this topic, I found ["What is leadership" by Kevin Kruse](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinkruse/2013/04/09/what-is-leadership/), which I liked particularly. I thought about
sharing the key takeaways from that blog post as it expresses very well the general points about what *is* and what *is not*
leadership.

## What is not leadership?

Leadership has nothing to do with titles. Just because you have a C-level title, doesn't automatically make you a 
"leader". You don't need a leading title to become a leader.

Leadership has nothing to do with your personal attributes. Leadership is not an adjective. You don't have to be an
extroverted charismatic person to practice leadership.

Leadership and management are not synonymous. Management needs to plan, measure, monitor, coordinate, solve, hire, fire,
etc. Managers manage *things*. Leaders lead **people**.

## What is leadership?

> "A leader is someone who has followers." Peter Drucker.

This definition is too simplistic and can be dangerous. Just because you have "under you" some people that do what you
say simply "following orders" doesn't mean that you are a leader. You might be a commander, but not necessarily a
leader.

> "The capacity to translate vision into reality." Warren Bennis.

Every sprint, you vision fruits in your garden. And you work towards it and make that happen. This makes you a gardener,
not a leader.

> "Leaders will be those who empower others." Bill Gates.

Empowering others is essential, but it's missing the vision or common goal.

> "Leadership is influence." John Maxwell.

A manager has the power to fire team members, which provides a lot of influence. Same as a robber with a gun who has 
"influence" over their victims. We are missing the source of influence.

### So, what about combining them all?

> "Leadership is a process of social influence, which maximizes the efforts of others toward the achievement of a goal." Kevin Kruse

Key elements of this definition:

- Leadership starts from social influence, not authority or power
- Leadership requires others, not necessarily direct reports
- It includes a goal
- No mention of a title or attributes of any kind

## Why would anyone want to become a leader?

We need to make clear that there are two different conceptions when asking that question, and we need to separate them
from the beginning.

There is the "leader title" aspect, which is usually attached to the management position. I am **not** talking about
that one. You can be a great manager and an appalling leader.

A leader is a person with the **multiplier** factor attitude that wants to develop specific skills (related to their
social influence) to boost even more the value they produce.

So, can anyone become a leader? What are those *skills* that you need to be a leader?

## Can everyone become a leader?

Now that we found a definition of leadership, we can agree that this definition could have different degrees
applied depending on the type of person and responsibilities they want.

However, to become a leader, you need specific skills. These are the ones I find the most important:

- Excellent **communication**, giving support, and enabling the people around you
- Leading by **example**, especially to become a better self
- **Passion** for sharing your leadership skills, so you build other leaders

> Leadership starts within your own life and behaviour.

I am aware that not everyone might want to accept the necessary changes to become a leader, but I truly believe
everyone can grow certain leadership skills to some extent, which also means **inspiring** the people around you.

## How to become a better leader?

You can get inspiration from a lot of different sources. While it's true that you can learn a lot from your own mistakes
and successes, and even from the people around you, I think it's very optimal to listen to the wisdom from other people's
experiences outside your circle. For example listening to podcasts, ted-talks, books, or even audiobooks.
