In 1965, psychologist Bruce Tuckman developed a model (Tuckman's Model) that describes the stages of group development, forming and maturing into a cohesive and effective team. 

<!-- more -->

The model initially consisted of four stages: "_**forming**, **storming**, **norming**,_ and _**performing**_," adding one additional "_**adjourning**_" in 1977.

It's important to note that teams may not always progress through these stages linearly, and they might revert to a previous stage under certain circumstances.

## Forming

In this initial stage, team members are polite, tentative, and unsure about their roles. There is a reliance on the leader for guidance.

> **Goal**: Members are getting to know each other, and there is a focus on defining the team's purpose, goals, and roles.

#### Leadership approach

- Provide clear direction and guidance
- Clearly define team goals, roles, and expectations
- Act as a facilitator, encouraging open communication and helping team members get to know each other.

## Storming

Conflict and disagreement emerge as team members start to express their individuality. There may be power struggles and challenges to the leader's authority.

> **Goal**: The team clarifies its goals, members learn to resolve conflicts and address differences constructively.

#### Leadership approach

- Facilitate conflict resolution
- Acknowledge and address conflicts constructively
- Encourage open and honest communication while guiding the team through the process of understanding and appreciating diverse perspectives

## Norming

Cohesion begins to develop, and team members establish norms and values. Roles become clearer, and there is a sense of unity.

> **Goal**: The team strives to establish norms, values, and a shared understanding. Members learn to appreciate each other's strengths and weaknesses.

#### Leadership approach

- Foster collaboration and inclusivity
- Encourage team members to establish norms and values collectively
- Recognize and celebrate individual strengths, fostering a sense of unity and mutual respect

## Performing

The team is highly functional, with a focus on achieving its goals. Members work collaboratively, trust each other, and are mutually supportive.

> **Goal**: The team is committed to its common purpose and operates at a high level of efficiency and effectiveness.

#### Leadership approach

- Empower autonomy and trust
- Provide opportunities for team members to take ownership of tasks and projects
- Foster an environment where individuals feel confident in their abilities and can collaborate seamlessly

## Adjourning (or Mourning)

This stage involves the completion of the task or project. Team members may experience a sense of loss as the group disbands.

> **Goal**: Acknowledge and celebrate the team's achievements, provide closure, and reflect on the overall experience.

#### Leadership approach

- Acknowledge achievements and provide closure
- Recognize the team's accomplishments and express gratitude for individual contributions
- Facilitate a reflective session to capture lessons learned and create a positive closure experience

To develop a team to a high-performance level using [Tuckman's Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuckman's_stages_of_group_development), **leaders** should be aware of the stages and **adapt** their leadership style accordingly.

This involves providing **guidance and structure** during the _forming_ stage, **facilitating conflict resolution** during _storming_, **fostering collaboration and communication** during _norming_, **empowering autonomy** during _performing_, and **recognizing achievements** during _adjourning_. 

> Regular communication, team-building activities, and constructively addressing conflicts are crucial throughout the process.
