## Types of taxes

Consider Taxes as a three-course meal: **direct**, **indirect**, and **special**.

### Direct taxes: What you earn and own

These Taxes are based on your income, assets, or gains:
- **Income Tax:** This is the big one. It's progressive, meaning the more you earn, the higher your pay rate. Income Tax applies to salaries, freelancing income, rental earnings, and investment gains.
- **Corporate Tax:** This Tax is paid on businesses' profits. Rates vary by country, but a general rate of 20-30% is common.
- **Wealth Tax:** Some countries tax high-net-worth individuals on their total assets, like properties or savings. Rates and exemptions depend on where you live.
- **Inheritance and Gift Tax:** When you inherit assets or receive a significant gift, you must pay taxes. The rate often depends on your relationship with the giver.

### Indirect taxes: What you spend

These Taxes are baked into the price of goods and services:
- **Value-Added Tax (VAT):** A Tax on almost everything you buy. Standard rates range from 10-25% in most countries, though essential goods like food and medicine often have reduced rates.
- **Excise Taxes:** Special Taxes on products like alcohol, tobacco, and fuel. They're designed to raise revenue while discouraging consumption.

### Property and local taxes: Owning stuff costs money

If you own, rent, or sell property, these Taxes come into play:
- **Property Tax:** Paid annually based on the value of your home or land.
- **Transfer Tax:** When buying a 2nd-hand property, you might pay a % of its price.
- **Capital Gains Tax:** When selling a property or other assets for a profit.

### Other Taxes and fees: The little extras

These include fees for registering vehicles, paying for waste collection, and obtaining permits. They might seem minor, but they add up over time.

## How do they work?

![cover](/images/blog/2025-01-02/middle.jpg)

Taxes are usually a mix of **national**, **regional**, and **local** responsibilities:

- National taxes have **standardized rates**, like income Tax or VAT.
- Regional taxes vary **depending on where you live**, like wealth or inheritance taxes.
- Local taxes are **specific to your city** or town, like property or waste fees.

Taxes are often deducted directly from employees' paychecks. Freelancers and business owners, on the other hand, need to calculate and pay their Taxes regularly.

## Why do we pay taxes?

Taxes are **meant to pay for public services** like roads, healthcare, schools, and pensions to make life better for everyone. But the system's complexity and how the money is spent often make it feel unfair.

### Are Taxes fair? 

This depends on two big questions: **Who should pay? How much is fair?**

#### The case for taxes

- Taxes **fund essential services** we all use, like hospitals and schools.
- **Progressive taxes**, where higher earners pay more, help reduce inequality and create stronger communities.

#### The case against taxes

- Some taxes, like **wealth or inheritance taxes, feel unfair** —they take money that's already been earned.
- Worse, when governments **waste Tax money on corruption or bad decisions**, people feel like they're paying for nothing.

It feels **unfair when governments waste the money**. If services don't improve or funds are mismanaged, it's **frustrating to see your money disappear without benefit**.

Taxes would seem much fairer if people trusted their money was being spent wisely. Without trust, paying **Taxes feels like throwing money into a black hole**.

## A new perspective

![cover](/images/blog/2025-01-02/middle-2.jpg)

Taxes are supposed to fund critical public services, but the biggest problem with taxes—and big governments—is that they often lead to **inefficiency and corruption**. The more power a government has, the more likely it is to misuse it. That's why governments should be (for me) **small, focused, and efficient**, providing essential services without overcomplicating things or overreaching into people's lives.

Here is where **Bitcoin offers an interesting alternative**. Bitcoin is decentralized, which means no one controls it—not governments, banks, or anyone; this removes the risk of corruption or mismanagement by powerful institutions. Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on a public ledger that anyone can verify, so it's **transparent and resistant to manipulation**.

While most countries (desire) tax Bitcoin transactions, using **Bitcoin gives people more control over their money**. Unlike traditional currencies that governments can print endlessly —causing inflation and lowering the value of savings— Bitcoin has a **limited supply**, so its value can't be diluted similarly. It's also borderless, meaning you can send and receive money without relying on banks or other intermediaries that might take a cut or add delays.

### Inflation: The hidden tax

**Inflation** is often called a "**hidden tax**," and for good reason. When governments print money endlessly to fund their spending, the value of the existing money drops. This means **your hard-earned savings can buy less over time**.

While politicians benefit in the short term by having more money to spend without directly raising taxes, ordinary people pay the price through higher living costs. **Inflation is theft**, as it quietly takes value away from everyone's money to cover the government's poor financial decisions.

With its **fixed supply of 21 million** coins, Bitcoin cannot be inflated in this way. **Its scarcity ensures that no one**, including politicians, **manipulates its value**. For people frustrated by rising prices and shrinking savings, Bitcoin offers a way to protect their wealth from the damaging effects of inflation. It's **a system designed to reward savers**, not punish them.

### Final thoughts

**Bitcoin** doesn't eliminate Taxes or public services but **challenges how we think about money and power**. It gives people more **control over their wealth** and shows how financial systems work without needing large, often corrupt institutions. It's **a step toward a world where individuals have more freedom** and governments focus on being small, efficient, and fair.
