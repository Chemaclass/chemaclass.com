Documents, Spreadsheets…, Excels over Excels, meetings over meetings, without much impact… team misalignments realized too late… -how we manage an organization will define its quality. Excellent Management is crucial to avoid the Waterfall trap if we aim to build an Agile environment. But why would we want that? What's wrong with the way we already work?

If you are already happy with how you work and your system, that's perfectly fine. You might not need to continue reading. However, are you so satisfied that you don't need to reevaluate your work (and how you work!) to look for potential improvements?

I am referring to evaluating your system and the challenge of how you and the people around you act as part of it. What we thought worked years ago might differ from what we could discover today -- as part of continuous improvement.

I dislike politics-pure Game of Thrones style-where each team looks for themselves instead of a bigger shared direction. This results in working daily with fear from above, passing it through to the people below, helping maintain an unhealthy working environment.

Agile was born precisely as a response to the excessive waste generated by politics and micromanagement within organizations.

The controlling and "slow performance" needed a more flexible approach. Agile solved this by focusing on teamwork, continuous delivery, and flexible planning. By prioritizing people over strict processes, Agile reduced waste, boosted productivity, and encouraged continuous improvement and adaptability.

When people adopt a fixed mindset, they resist change, fear failure, and prioritize rigid processes and hierarchies. This conflicts with Agile's core ideas of embracing change, iterative development, and fostering collaboration and innovation.

Learning from mistakes, adapting to new information, and continuously improving are crucial in an Agile environment. A fixed mindset, however, leads to fear of experimentation and a reluctance to challenge the status quo, reducing progress and the potential for quickly delivering value.

Cultivating a growth mindset that encourages flexibility, open-mindedness, and a commitment to ongoing development is essential for Agile success.

## What kills agility?

- **Fixed Mindset**: Resistance to change, fear of failure, and prioritizing rigid processes over learning and adaptation with innovation and flexibility.
- **Excessive Bureaucracy**: Complex processes and excessive documentation slow down decision-making and responsiveness.
- **Micromanagement**: Over-controlling leadership undermines team autonomy.
- **Lack of Collaboration**: Poor communication and teamwork.
- **Ineffective Feedback Loops**: Prevent adjustments and continuous improvement.
- **Fear of Experimentation**: A culture that punishes failure discourages experimentation and learning from mistakes.
- **Inflexible Processes**: Strictness without adapting to project needs.
- **Misaligned Goals**: Conflicting priorities and reduced efficiency.
- **Lack of Support from Leadership**: Without backing from upper management, Agile initiatives can struggle to gain the necessary resources and commitment.
- **Poor Technical Practices**: Neglecting technical excellence and good design can lead to a fragile codebase that is difficult to adapt and extend.

### What can you do about it?

Learn the basics of Extreme Programming (XP) and Lean Software Development. 

- XP is highly focused on software development practices and technical excellence, with specific practices like pair programming and TDD.
- Lean takes a broader approach, focusing on removing waste, optimizing flow, and improving processes across the organization.
