## A Tech Lead is a Developer who is a Leader

A good leader is making sure that the team is moving in the same direction. The team moves further altogether, rather
than simply people who are working "together".

## Leadership skills to invest in

- Empathy
- Self-Awareness
- Motivation
- Conflict Resolution
- Communication
- Coaching
- Feedback
- Influencing
- Delegation

The Tech Lead role is a leadership position, not necessarily a management position.

## Surprises & Struggle

- Feeling Alone: "Outsider". Different role. Shield/Filter. 
- Uncertainty: No right answer. Binary habit. Imperfect information.
- People are puzzling: Unique. Different Strengths. Archetypes.

## A Great Tech Lead

A great Tech Leader is really focusing on developing others, so the team will get better capabilities.

### Tell or Delegate?

The goal is to reach a complete delegation, step by step. It's about starting to shift responsibilities to other people,
so they grow as well. It can also depend on the skills, motivations, and urgency of the task.
