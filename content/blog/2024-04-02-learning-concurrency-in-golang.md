I wanted to learn a new programming language, so after trying some, I ended up with Golang as one of my favorites for its simplicity and capabilities. It has features I haven’t used in years, like multithreading and concurrency.

<!-- more -->

[Golang](https://go.dev/) (or `Go`) supports concurrency through _**lightweight threads**_ called **_goroutines_**, different from traditional multithreading (like in Java*). While the usage may seem similar, Go's concurrency model provides efficient parallelism and asynchronous execution, managed at the language level for better scalability and resource utilization.

> *In traditional multithreading from Java, threads are heavyweight, managed by the OS, and can consume significant system resources. Developers must handle synchronization and coordination to manage shared resources safely. In contrast, Golang's goroutines are lightweight, managed by the Go runtime, and are cheaper to create and manage.

I remember building a similar game in `Java` when I was learning multithreading ten years ago… let’s use this opportunity to do it again with modern `Go`.

I built a terminal game emulator that mimics one horse racing. Each horse is a goroutine that runs in a shared bidimensional matrix. Once a horse reaches the end, it notifies the shared channel between all other horses --running in different processes-- and they all stop, showing in the terminal the winner of the race.

I separated the code into four areas to help visualize it:
- Entry point
- Generating the board
- Rendering the game
- Moving the horses


![cover](/images/blog/2024-04-02/race-horses-demo.gif)

### Entry point

The struct `Horse` represents each Horse in the race. 
The game consists of a list of lines, in which each Horse is running.

```go
type Horse struct {
  Name string // The name of the horse
  Line int    // The competition line
}

func (h *Horse) Letter() string {
  return fmt.Sprintf("%c", h.Name[0])
}

func (h *Horse) Equals(other *Horse) bool {
  return other != nil &&
    h.Line == other.Line &&
    h.Name == other.Name
}

func (h *Horse) String() string {
  return fmt.Sprintf("%s (line:%d)", h.Name, h.Line)
}
```

You can spawn a new process using the keyword `go` when invoking any function.
In this game, this is used 1) to render the game `RenderGame()` and 2) for each horse's movement `startRuningHorseInLine()`. The goal is to keep the "rendering" and "movement logic" working in parallel.

```go
func main() {
  const lines, lineLength = 12, 30

  board := NewRaceBoard(lines, lineLength)
  go RenderGame(board)

  winnerChan := make(chan Horse)
  for line := range board {
    // each horse will be moved in different processes
    go startRunningHorseInLine(board, line, winnerChan)
  }

  // wait until one horse reaches the end
  winner := <-winnerChan
  // render one last time to ensure the latest board state
  RenderRaceBoard(board, &winner)

  fmt.Println("Race finished!")
  fmt.Printf("# Winner: %s\n", winner.String())
}
```

### Generating the board

The race board is a bidimensional matrix of pointers to Horses. Each line "contains" only one Horse; aka only one pointer will point to an actual Horse, the rest will be pointers to `nil`. During the generation of the Board, we will create one Horse at the first position of each line.

```go
func NewRaceBoard(lines, lineLength int) [][]*Horse {
  board := make([][]*Horse, lines)
  for line := range board {
    board[line] = make([]*Horse, lineLength)
    board[line][0] = &Horse{
      Name: generateHorseName(),
      Line: line,
    }
  }
  return board
}
```

The names are randomly generated using `HorseNames`.

```go
var HorseNames = [][2]string{
  {"Alloping", "Giggles"},
  {"A-lot", "Gallop"},
  {"BoJack", "Jack"},
  {"Baroness", "Belle"},
  // ...
}

func generateHorseName() string {
  name := HorseNames[rand.Intn(len(HorseNames))][0]
  surname := HorseNames[rand.Intn(len(HorseNames))][1]

  return name + " " + surname
}
```

### Rendering the game

Then `RenderGame()`, `renderRaceBoard()`, `renderRaceLine()` and `renderRacePosition()` are separated to help focus on each method's responsibility --identifying what is the subject to be rendered.

> `RenderGame()` is being executed in another process using `go`.

```go
func RenderGame(board [][]*Horse) {
  for {
    time.Sleep(renderDelay * time.Millisecond)
    RenderRaceBoard(board, nil)
  }
}

func RenderRaceBoard(board [][]*Horse, winner *Horse) {
  // use a "string buffer" to save the whole board state
  // so we can later use one IO call to render it
  var buffer bytes.Buffer
  buffer.WriteString("\n")
  for line := range board {
    renderRaceLine(board, line, &buffer, winner)
  }
  clearScreen()
  fmt.Println(buffer.String())
}

func clearScreen() {
  cmd := exec.Command("clear")
  cmd.Stdout = os.Stdout
  cmd.Run()
}

func renderRaceLine(
  board [][]*Horse,
  line int,
  buffer *bytes.Buffer,
  winner *Horse,
) {
  buffer.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf(" %.2d | ", line))
  var current Horse
  for col := range board[line] {
    h := renderRacePosition(board, line, col, buffer, winner)
    if h != nil {
      current = *h
    }
  }
  buffer.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf("| %s", current.Name))

  if current.Equals(winner) {
    buffer.WriteString(" [Won!]")
  }
  buffer.WriteString("\n")
}

func renderRacePosition(
  board [][]*Horse,
  line, col int,
  buffer *bytes.Buffer,
  winner *Horse,
) *Horse {
  if board[line][col] == nil {
    buffer.WriteString(" ")
    return nil
  }

  current := board[line][col]

  if current.Equals(winner) {
    removeChars(buffer, col+1)
    for range board[line] {
      buffer.WriteString("-")
    }
  }

  buffer.WriteString(current.Letter())

  return current
}
```

### Moving the horses

In `main(...)`, the `winnerChan` is a shared channel that will be used by the first Horse reaching the last position in their line.

Each Horse will run a loop until reaching the end of the line OR receiving (via the shared channel `winnerChan`) the message that another Horse already won the race. Until then, each horse will move independently by randomly sleeping milliseconds before moving to the next position in their line.

> `startRuningHorseInLine()` runs in another process using `go`.

```go
func main() {
  //...
  winnerChan := make(chan Horse)
  for line := range board {
    // each horse will be moved in different processes
    go startHorseRunning(board, line, winnerChan)
  }
  // wait until one horse reaches the end
  winner := <-winnerChan
  //...
}

func startRunningHorseInLine(board [][]*Horse, line int, winnerChan chan Horse) {
  for {
    select {
    case <-winnerChan: // check if another horse finished
      return // in such a case, then stop the for loop
    default:
      time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * time.Duration(rand.Intn(maxSleepDelay)))
      moveHorseOnePos(board, line, winnerChan)
    }
  }
}

func moveHorseOnePos(board [][]*Horse, line int, winnerChan chan Horse) {
  cols := len(board[line])
  for col := cols - 1; col > 0; col-- {
    if board[line][col-1] == nil {
      continue
    }
    // here we identify that there is a horse in
    // the following column, so we move it to the
    // current column, and we set `nil`` the other one
    board[line][col] = board[line][col-1]
    board[line][col-1] = nil

    if col+1 == cols {
      winnerChan <- *board[line][col]
    }
    break
  }
}
```

The code displayed in this post is a simplified version, so if you would like to check the working source, you can do it here: [Chemaclass/go-horse-racing](https://github.com/Chemaclass/go-horse-racing).

> Thanks to my former Team Lead, Andrei Boar, who helped me review my first original solution and provided an [alternative solution](https://gist.github.com/zuzuleinen/79413aa7933d7d6c6d84ec6ba8c3910a) (simpler and better!), which I applied to my original code. The main learning was using a `chan Horse` to pass the winner Horse from `main()`, instead of using a `chan bool` and a `sync.WaitGroup` between all threads.
