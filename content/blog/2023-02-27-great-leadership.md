As business scales, the leaders' primary focus must shift from customers to employees. Therefore, I would like to share what I consider critical points that any leader should address and focus on regularly.

For each key point, you will have book recommendations that go deeper into the matter, giving you references from real experts behind them.

I already wrote about the [beauty of leadership](/blog/the-beauty-of-leadership/), and as a quick recap, to become a leader, you need specific skills:

- Excellent **communication**, giving support, and enabling your people
- Leading by **example**, especially to become a better self
- **Passion** for sharing your leadership skills, so you build other leaders

To extend the previous post providing resources and examples, in this one, you will find books about the following topics:

- Motivation
- Empowering your people
- Effective communication
- Persuasion
- Team dysfunctions
- Management principles
- CEO Mindset
- Engineering leadership

## For "starting" leaders

### Motivation

First of all, you need to define a **purpose** for your leadership. I would recommend "[Start with Why](/readings/start-with-why/)", as this can help you clarify the difference between great leaders and those who are not.

> "The ability to inspire those around you and to achieve remarkable things starts with WHY." -- Start with Why

You need to be aware that leadership is not about being the boss of anyone but **serving** others. It would help if you were a role example that your people would copy and follow, especially in hard times. This is a leadership philosophy in which the leader aims to serve. "[Leaders Eat Last](/readings/leaders-eat-last/)" goes deeper into this topic.

After reading the previous two books, if you are looking for more, the cherry on top is "[The infinite game](/readings/the-infinite-game/)", which is the third and last book (so far) by Simon Sinek. This book questions our daily mindset when confronting (business) problems. It's about the need of a _just cause, courageous leadership, trusting teams,_ and a _worthy rival._

> "There is no such thing as the one "right" organization. There are only organizations, each of which has distinct strengths, distinct limitations, and specific applications. An organization is not absolute. It is a tool for making people productive in working together." -- The infinite game

### Empowering your people

It would be best if you empowered your people to become leaders themselves. A great book I recommend is "[Turn the ship around!](/readings/turn-the-ship-around/)", in which the author challenges the commonly accepted **leaders vs. followers** model into a **leaders-to-leaders** relationship.

> "Leadership is communicating to people their worth so clearly that they are inspired to see it in themselves." -- Turn the ship around!

### Effective communication

Communication is one of the most challenging skills you need because you constantly communicate with other people; with different backgrounds, experiences, expectations, and even understanding of life. And the important key aspect is not just what you say but how you say it to ensure your desired message is correctly delivered to the receiver. 

"[Leadership is Language](/readings/leadership-is-language/)" challenges the industrial-age playbook (where leaders give commands and employees follow them), giving you strategies that can help you such as: _control the clock, collaborate, commit, complete, and improve_.

> "Your words matter more than you think." -- Leadership is Language

It is important to recognize our emotions and not let them control our actions. Creating an open, honest, and **safe environment** is crucial to create trust among your peers.

"[Dare to lead](/readings/dare-to-lead/)" addresses that leaders need to be more vulnerable. It shows that solid values guide you to do what is correct rather than easy. The importance of trust and difficult conversations even when they make you uncomfortable.

> "Great leaders must be brave and always dare to provide constructive feedback, speak the truth, and be clear about their expectations." -- Dare to lead

### Persuasion

Regarding communication, you might need some good persuasion skills to convince others about your ideas. "[Never split the difference](/readings/never-split-the-difference/)" is a book about negotiation (from one FBI's lead international kidnapping negotiator) that gives you great insides into how to negotiate effectively: negotiation begins with listening, using mirrors to encourage the other side to empathise, tactical empathy to getting an agreement, labelling emotions, among others.

> "Negotiation begins with listening, making it about the other people, validating their emotions, and creating enough trust and safety for a real conversation to begin." -- Never split the difference

## For "experienced" leaders

Assuming you have read the books above (for "starting leaders") I can give you more recommendations.

### Team dysfunctions

One of the most difficult areas from the communication layer is dealing effectively with conflicts; so "[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team](/readings/the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-team/)" is a great book which addresses the "absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability and inattention to results" as a pyramid of dysfunctions that you need to pay attention.

### Management principles

Although leadership is not the same as management, I find it quite useful knowing some theory behind management, and for this "[High Output Management](/readings/high-output-management/)" is a great starting point. 

After that one, if you want more, I can recommend something more advance with "[The Essential Drucker](/readings/the-essential-drucker/)", which addresses the essential principles of management.

> "Management is about humans." -- The Essential Drucker

### CEO Mindset

Although not every leader might want to be a CEO, I find "[The Great CEO Within](/readings/the-great-ceo-within/)" a great book because this can help you understand the responsibilities from any organization's most abstract point of view.

Similarly, "[Adapt or Die](/readings/adapt-or-die/)" is a great book that covers the fundamental aspects of overall responsibilities and capabilities to thrive in any business, addressing aspects such as Product, Strategy, Growth Engine, Financial Model, People, Operations, Process, and Leadership.

> "Leadership is about helping people adapt and leading through change so the business and its people can thrive." -- Adapt or die

### Engineering leadership

Related to engineering and growing,  I also recommend "[The Manager Path](/readings/manager-path/)", and "[The Art of Leadership](/readings/the-art-of-leadership/)", both great books; easy to read and full of wisdom.

> "Managers tell you where you are; leaders tell you where you are going." -- The Art of Leadership

I hope I got enough attention to create awareness about the key areas you must work on. I am aware that many other books could be included in this list. You might have others on your shelf. These are just a reference, not necessarily better or worse than others.

I still have many other books I want/will read over time. Still, I thought it would be interesting to compile these already, aiming to create value, sharing especially for those who don’t know where to start or how to become better leaders themselves.

However, these are the essential points to remember:

- You need to have **passion for your work** and share this passion with the people around you. You cannot expect passion from your peers if you don’t have passion for what you do.
- You need to **empower your people**, creating leaders instead of folks who follow orders from their superiors.
- You need to learn how to create a **safe environment**, which is crucial for trust and honest relationships.
- You need to help **create agreements** when dealing with conflict resolutions. Avoiding healthy conflicts doesn't help long-term relationships.
- You have to look for **opportunities to grow** everywhere and help our team grow with you.

Your primary responsibility is to help others improve, and this is only possible if you **embrace the change** and **start with yourself**.
