One of the most complicated topics for everyone, without exception, is avoiding misunderstandings and being aware that
other people don't think the same way as you do.

### Different perceptions

People have different experiences and backgrounds, and we all have different perceptions of reality. This is the first
thing we need to be aware of if we want to create a self-awareness of empathy with others.

Empathy is more important than we think; it is your ability to put yourself in other people's shoes, so you can get to a
better understanding with minimum friction.

Very often, the real issue behind different people, the root of this friction that seems to be there (and even sometimes
no one knows how or why they don't like each other anymore), is their **inability to be in the position of the other**.

> Empathy is the ability to understand what other people feel, see things from their point of view, and imagine yourself
> in their place. Essentially, it is putting yourself in someone else's position.

### Misunderstandings

Our understanding of a conversation might differ from what the other person perceives, which could (and often will)
cause a problem. This can become a serious problem related to the relationship's direction between both parties.

Especially in those cases, the solution never starts by fixing the other person. Instead, work on **making yourself more
explicit**. For example:

- Work on clarifying the expectations around the common goal
  - Create an open and honest conversation about your expectations
  - Assumptions are dangerous
- Provide as much context as needed
  - Even if it seems evident to you at first instance
- Every little detail counts
  - More information is always better than less

### Effective communication

While aiming for effective communication, we need to **reduce the risk of misunderstandings to zero**.

> Providing as much context as possible can help you clarify thoughts and ensure there is no room for misunderstandings.

Healthy conflicts are expected and fine. We shouldn't be afraid of disagreements. It's ok to change our minds
when discovering new possibilities; the sooner, the better.

In my experience, understanding people is complicated for multiple reasons, but most especially because of
misunderstandings we generate due to missing context, more than disagreements.

### Self-reflection

If something doesn't work as expected, start looking at yourself, not blaming others when dealing with people. What
could you have said to create more clarity? What would you do differently?

Self-reflection is essential to improve and correct your attitude, adapting to the evolution of the constant change we
are surrounded by, **especially when dealing with people**.

> Look over your reach area, share your thoughts, and don't be ashamed of your mistakes as far as you take them as
> learning opportunities.
