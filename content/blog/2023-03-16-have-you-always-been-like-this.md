I've got this question recently, a couple of times. And I think this is a great topic to talk about.

> "Have you always been like this? Constantly reading books, writing blog posts, public speaker in conferences and meet-ups, learning in your private time, etc…?"

The short answer is: No. But that wouldn't be enough for a blog post, so let's go deeper into the topic.

## An introvert who didn't like reading

I used to be introverted, but somehow I managed to master some public speaking skills. Although, this doesn't mean I was capable of speaking at an international conference in front of dozens of people like nowadays.

I used to dislike reading, I preferred always other sources of getting information and learn new things. From all of them, reading was the most boring one.

However, I have always enjoyed writing since I was a kid. For personal circumstances, writing was a way to express and reflect on myself, doing constant retrospectives about the ideas in my head. 

### Writing to the rescue

Writing was (and still is) a way to sort out my thoughts, especially during hard times; writing was a way to escape from the world. It helped me to understand myself better the day after. And it worked.

Knowing your limitations can help you understand your reality and fight against it. Life is hard enough to accept whatever "is there" even if you are clearly dissatisfied with it. Most especially, if you have a reason for that.

I learned that I don't want to waste my time in a life I will regret when I die. For that reason, I started seeking for opportunities to growth at everything I do, all the time.

### Will I always be like this?

> "Are you all the time 100% learning and being productive?"

You cannot be 100% productive all the time. That's impossible because our human nature. Life is about constants "ups and downs"; and this is also part of its beauty. It's your responsibility to understand yourself, and by that I mean truly understand your emotions and your persona. Who are "you"? What differentiate "you" really from other people? What differentiate "your today you" from "your 1 year ago you"?

Within your context, and your possibilities, you are what you choose to be. And that's what differentiate you from your past and your future. The actions that you do, the way you communicate and interacts with others, the decisions you choose, etc…, that's what differentiate you. That's what differentiate you from yourself in another point of time.

This is why I enjoy reading - or listening a book - per month. This is why I enjoy learning any time, all the time. This is why I like to share what I know with others. 

A few years ago, I wrote about [the process itself as the goal](/blog/the-process-itself-is-the-goal/), which says basically: "Repetition is the key. Make it easier to do what you want to do. Make it harder to do what you want to stop doing. Enjoy the process: that's the goal."

## How much time do I have?

I like to prove myself wrong and challenge the status quo. I decided to learn how I could be one of the speakers at a conference. The hardest step is always the first; once you're there, it's more fun than you initially thought. I might write a dedicated post about this "public speaking" topic. For now, you can check some tips I wrote about [improving your public speaking talks](/blog/improve-your-tech-talk/).

Regarding reading, I need around 4 to 6 hours (average) to finish a book. A normal working day can be divided in 3 slots of 8h; 8 sleep, 8 work, 8 leisure. I don't work on the weekend, so those days are 16h each of leisure. So, assuming I work 5 days per week, this means _5 days x 8 hours (working days) + 2 days x 16 hours (weekend) = 72 hours_ of leisure time within a week!

### Time is not the problem

Within a month, I have **72 hours x 4 weeks = 288 hours** of leisure time to spare with my girlfriend, talking to my family, playing music, partying or chilling with friends, going to the gym, walking in a park, traveling for a weekend..., but also going to the supermarket, doing the dishes, preparing the evening meals, clean the apartment, commuting to work…, all of this requires time.

The problem isn't time but the priorities I define. Within a month, I can really do a lot of things. The issue I usually encounter is not having a clear goal about what I want to reach in the middle-long goal for myself.

There might be others, but [The power of habits](/readings/the-power-of-habits/) and [Atomic habits](/readings/atomic-habits/) were the books I read so far about habits that impacted me the most, and I think they might help you if you are struggling with habits that you would like to change anyhow. It all starts by understanding yourself within your context.

I didn't expect things to change from one day to another. However, I enjoy experimenting, combining habits, and trying different approaches to improve and get the best out of them over time.

What keeps me moving is the time I have left and the idea of thinking, "what would I like to have changed?" And in such a case, "Why didn't I?"
