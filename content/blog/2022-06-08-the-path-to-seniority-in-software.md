We all have been junior developers at some point. This is easy to know because it's at the very beginning of your
carrier. Your responsibilities were narrowed down by other peers who were looking after you. Suddenly, at some point,
after some months or years, you got your promotion or another job, where you weren't a junior anymore, but a
professional.

<!-- more -->

A professional (also known as middle) is something between junior and senior. You know how you are not a junior anymore,
you know how to deliver value but yet you also have mixed feelings about seniority. You want to be a senior, but you
don't know how. There is no clear path to achieving this goal.

Wait for a second… there are actually two easy ways to get the senior title! You can get promoted as such in your
company, or you can start a new position as a "senior" in another company, easy, right?

## Marketing and polluted politics

Unfortunately, the "seniority" level is more polluted by marketing and politics than in reality. First, what
does "senior" in this context mean? In all companies (where I've been working for [if not all]) I've always been
surrounded by people who claimed been "seniors" when in the reality only a few I could consider as such.

Our senior industry is falsified by companies' need of having experts on the paper more than the reality, and this is a
problem we need to deal with and speak about.

Seniority means more experience, but how do you calculate this? It's easy from a company's point of view: more years in
the industry. But, is it really relevant the number of years you've been working in an industry which is in constantly
changing and evolving trend? Actually, this wouldn't be a big issue if you have the software fundamentals well
interiorized, but funny enough, I've seen these fundamentals just in ~10% of all seniors during my almost 10 years of
experience and 7 companies I've worked with.

The fact that you have been working 10 or more years in a company doesn't necessarily mean you are a "senior". What else
can we measure in order to identify if you deserve indeed this title?

### It's about the money

Let's be honest, senior titles are better paid than junior or middle positions. If you have the chance to get more
salary because you got the "senior" in your job title, it wouldn't be clever to reject it. But, independently from the
politics and marketing, we have to address some seniority fundamentals, to have a better understanding of what the word
senior means.

## Seniority fundamentals

Being senior in our software industry is not about "how many years of experience do you have?" but:

- How well can you **transmit your knowledge** to others? Sharing your knowledge is an important task for a senior person.
- How well can you **collaborate** with other people? Including the PO/PM, collaboration is crucial to create a constant
  feedback loop.
- How well can you **work together** with your peers? Pair-programming embraces team cohesion and helps the team become
  better.
- How well are your **testing** skills? Testing is highly related to the quality of your work, and a senior should aim
  for an incremental design.
- How well is your understanding of **delivering value constantly** in small chunks? The sooner you deliver value, the
  sooner you get feedback about it.
- How well is your **technical knowledge** related to quality software and the trade-offs to get there? SOLID 
  principles, clean code, TDD, refactoring as part of your daily job, low coupling, high cohesion, etc…
- How well are you capable to adapt and **cope with changes**? Change is inevitable, and therefore we must learn how to 
  deal with changes, especially the ones that we cannot control.

As you can see, there is no mention of concrete technology or years of experience. Why? Because technology is just an 
"implementation detail", and experience comes by practicing and attitude, not by letting the time pass by.

### Attitude is important

We've got two persons:

A) a person who is working for 15 years, doing relatively the same every day, and without caring about his own skills.

B) a person who is working for 5 years, challenging himself every week, trying different approaches when dealing with
problems, and sharpening her own skills constantly.

Can you see the main difference? No, it's not the 10 years difference of "experience" between them, but their **attitude**.

We wrongly understand that a year of experience must come with learning and knowledge, so we tend to use time as a
measurement of seniority. But I argue that the "attitude factor" is equal or even more important. I've been surrounded
by many people who call themselves seniors with 3, 6, 10, and more years of "experience" but lacking attitude, and you
could clearly see this problem on a daily basis.

You need this combination to build yourself as a truly senior developer; time, experience, and most importantly:
attitude towards **improving your own skills and the ones that surround you**.
