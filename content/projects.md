## Some of OSS org contributions ðŸŒš

### Gacela Project

[GitHub](https://github.com/gacela-project/gacela) | started on 2021

A PHP library that helps you to split the logic of your app into different modules.

I created this project because I wanted to improve the internal structure of [Phel Lang](https://phel-lang.org/) by
normalizing the communication between the modules while applying all the learnings that I got after studying Spryker.

### Phel Lang

[GitHub](https://github.com/phel-lang/phel-lang) | started on 2020

Phel is a functional programming language that compiles to PHP. It is a dialect of Lisp inspired by Clojure and Janet.

I am not the author of this project but a collaborator. I found it by accident (in June 2020). Since then, I have used
it as a constant "kata place" to try some refactoring and testing techniques. Always trying new things and play around.
At the same time, I am part of a fun project with significant potential growth: in terms of usability and learning
skills.

I already wrote about this on *February 2021*: [Phel: A Lisp that compiles to PHP](/blog/phel-first-release/).

### NuevaMetal (Abandoned)

[GitHub](https://github.com/NuevaMetal/nm_template) | 2013â€“2016

It was a website where you could find new rock/metal bands with new releases and or classics almost every day. By that
time, this project wasn't open-source. But after two years working on it, I wanted to share my learnings, so I decided
to create my first OSS project where I could share an agnostic version of it named: Knob-MVC.

I couldn't continue working on NuevaMetal due to a shift in my priorities. After learning how to write decent code (the
code was/is a complete mess!), it was pretty hard to catch up and restructure it, so I had to abandon that project. The
same happened to Knob-MVC once I realized how messy that one also was. I don't like working with WordPress anymore.

## Books ðŸ“š

### Ojos en un Recuerdo (2015 - 2017)

[Read more](/books)

I used to have a personal blog back in 2015. I wrote about my thoughts and feelings because I wanted to do some
retrospectives later on, to help me understand myself better. I started in January 2015, and by December 2017, I
published a book with all these reflections.

There is an audiobook in Spanish as well: [https://youtu.be/e8K8CrL_W-0](https://youtu.be/e8K8CrL_W-0).
