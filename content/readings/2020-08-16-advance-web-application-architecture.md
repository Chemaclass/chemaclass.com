This book helps you get your web applications back in shape. It contains many techniques for decoupling from
infrastructure (like the framework, the database, or remote web services). In Part 1 we unlock a collection of design
patterns which help you establish a clean separation between core and infrastructure code. Part 2 shows how these design
patterns resonate at a higher level with architectural concepts like layers, ports and adapters (a.k.a. Hexagonal
architecture). The book finishes with a discussion of testing strategies and design trade-offs.

> The best guide that brings your coding and architecture skills a level up. All the modern PHP features combined with the
elegance of a well designed modular design.

### What you'll learn

- Separating mixed code into core and infrastructure code by refactoring into patterns
- Dividing your code into layers, and making a clear distinction between an application's ports and adapters
- Testing decoupled applications
