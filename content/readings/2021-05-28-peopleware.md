Software development is about people: when, how and where they can best work together. Not about programming languages
or tools. Not about fast computers, networks or internet access (although that surely helps). Soft skills are truly
important in IT, more than people tend to think. Developing software is about people that communicate with their
customers and stakeholders, are supported by their managers and collaborate in teams.

### My favourite quotes from this book

- Staying late or arriving early is a damaging indictment of the office environment.
- Someone who can help a project to jell is worth two people who just do work.
- People should be asking and wondering why things are getting done the way they are being done.
- There must be always a trade between quality and quantity.

- Organisations tend to expand and create a “busy day”, creating a lot of meetings rather than trust their employees to self-organize.
- The human elements are usually the bottleneck of a project.
- People won’t work harder if you put them under pressure. They might work more for some time, but they will also get overburden and leave.
- Managers' real role is to make it possible for people to work, rather than forcing them to.

- Anything you need to quantify can be measured in any way that it’s superior to not measuring at all.
- The ultimate management sin is wasting people’s time.
- Change won’t even get started unless people feel safe.
- Change only has a chance of succeeding if failure (at least a little of failure) is also okay.

- Experience gets turned into learning when an organization alters itself to take account of what experience has shown.

Professionals want to develop themselves, and want to be happy at work. This book provides ideas in what managers and
developers can do to address these and other similar topics. If you are concerned with people, and looking for ways to
improve how you collaboratively develop and deliver software, then this book is for you.

I found also a nice serie that shares some thoughts over each chapter of this book.
