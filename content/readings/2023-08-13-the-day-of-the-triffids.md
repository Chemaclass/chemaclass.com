This book is fantastic and frightening but entirely plausible. It doesn't seem scientifically possible, but its characters are living people shaken out of the civilization they know into the horror of a world dominated by "triffids".

<!-- more -->

The triffids are grotesque and dangerous plants, over seven feet tall, originally cultivated for their yield of high-grade oil. So long as conditions give mastery to their human directors, they are a valuable asset to mankind. But when a sudden universal disaster turns those conditions upside down, the triffids, seizing their opportunity, become an active and dreadful menace.
