People think that when you want to change your life, you need to think big. James Clear has discovered another way. He
knows that real change comes from the compound effect of hundreds of small decisions. He calls them atomic habits.

### Takeaways

- Focus more on systems and processes and less on goals
- Change how you identify yourself
- The environment is more important than being motivated
- To break a bad habit, reduce exposure to the cues that cause it
- Bundle an action you want to do with an action you need to do
- Instead of saying "I have to,” say "I get to”
- Don't try to make a habit perfect, just repeat it
- Reduce friction for good habits and increase friction for bad habits
- To make something not seem like a chore, do it for short periods of time
- To achieve long-term goals, make small habits rewarding
- Never miss more than once of a habit
