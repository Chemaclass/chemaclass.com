Gigi portrays Bitcoin as more than just money; it's a deep dive into economics, philosophy, and culture. Like Alice in Wonderland, exploring Bitcoin is full of surprises, teaching about money, inflation, and the idea of decentralization. It redefines what 'good money' is, shows its cultural impact, and stresses that learning about Bitcoin is a personal journey that keeps evolving.

Bitcoin's lessons evolve, requiring ongoing study.
