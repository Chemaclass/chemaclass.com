influential, and more profitable than others? Why do some command greater loyalty from customers and employees alike?
Even among the successful, why are so few able to repeat their success over and over?

The ability to inspire those around you and to achieve remarkable things starts with WHY. Those who start with WHY never
manipulate, they inspire.

People like Martin Luther King Jr., Steve Jobs, and the Wright Brothers had little in common, but they all started with
WHY. They realized that people won't truly buy into a product, service, movement, or idea until they understand the WHY
behind it.

- The ability to inspire those around you and to achieve remarkable things starts with WHY.
- Any organization can explain what it does; some can explain how they do it; but very few can clearly articulate why.
- Your WHY is your purpose, cause or belief.
- Every inspiring leader and organization, regardless of size or industry, starts with WHY.
- When your WHY goes fuzzy, it becomes much more difficult to maintain the growth, loyalty, and inspiration that helped
  drive your original success.

> People don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.

Great leaders are able to inspire people to act. And those who are able to inspire give people a sense of purpose or
belonging that has little to do with any external incentive or benefit to be gained.
