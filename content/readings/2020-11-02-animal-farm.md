Mr Jones of Manor Farm is so lazy and drunken that one day he forgets to feed his livestock. The ensuing rebellion under
the leadership of the pigs Napoleon and Snowball leads to the animals taking over the farm. Vowing to eliminate the
terrible inequities of the farmyard, the renamed Animal Farm is organised to benefit all who walk on four legs. But as
time passes, the ideals of the rebellion are corrupted, then forgotten. And something new and unexpected emerges.
