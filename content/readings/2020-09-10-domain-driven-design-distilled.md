Domain-Driven Design (DDD) software modeling delivers powerful results in practice, which is why
developers worldwide are rapidly moving to adopt it.

Now, for the first time, there's an accessible guide to the basics of DDD:

- What it is?
- What problems it solves?
- How it works?
- How to quickly gain value from it?

You'll learn how to segregate domain models using the powerful Bounded Contexts pattern, to develop a Ubiquitous
Language within an explicitly bounded context, and to help domain experts and developers work together to create that
language.

How to use Subdomains to handle legacy systems and to integrate multiple Bounded Contexts to define both team
relationships and technical mechanisms.
