This book delivers powerful results in practice, which is why developers worldwide are rapidly moving to adopt it. 
This is an accessible guide to the basics:

- What is DDD?
- What problems does it solve?
- How does it work?
- How to quickly gain value from it?

You'll learn how to segregate domain models using the powerful **Bounded Contexts** pattern, to develop a **Ubiquitous
Language** within an explicitly bounded context and help **domain experts** and **developers work together** to create 
that language.

How to use Subdomains to handle legacy systems and integrate multiple Bounded Contexts to define team relationships and
technical mechanisms.

> Domain-Driven Design Distilled brings **DDD** to life.
