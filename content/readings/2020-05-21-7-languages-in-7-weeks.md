You should learn a programming language every year, as recommended by The Pragmatic Programmer. But if one per year is
good, how about Seven Languages in Seven Weeks? In this book you'll get a hands-on tour of Clojure, Haskell, Io, Prolog,
Scala, Erlang, and Ruby. Whether your favorite language is on that list, you'll broaden your perspective of
programming by examining these languages side-by-side. You'll learn something new from each, and best of all, you'll
learn how to learn a language quickly.
