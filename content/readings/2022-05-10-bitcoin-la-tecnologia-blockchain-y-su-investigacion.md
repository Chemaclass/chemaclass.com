This book was published in 2017, so most of the technology shown is already history. And that's precisely what I really
like from the book itself, the "historical part" and the origin of the blockchain.

How is created Bitcoin address? How does it work the creation of the private & public keys and how are they known as
wallets? And many other interesting questions.

Back then, we got some websites and services that were using Bitcoin as a payment method, and there was a beauty trend.

- The **first half of the book** is the best part, and I would say it's still relevant due to the origin of this tech.
- The **second half**, on the other hand, I would say is "more optional" and for curious people. There are no learnings 
  from this part, besides the trend that you can see we already had back in 2016/2017. Today in 2022 the tech (and 
  projects using blockchain) has evolved a lot.

I would really like to read a new book with an updated investigation 5 years after the first edition.
