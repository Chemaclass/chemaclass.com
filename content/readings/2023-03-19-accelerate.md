Accelerate explores how software development teams using **Lean Software** and **DevOps** can measure their performance and the performance of software engineering teams impacts the overall performance of an organization.

> Note: DevOps is about integrating and automating software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops), focusing on improving (and shortening) the systems development life cycle.

## Key Capabilities

- Implement Continuous Integration
- Use Trunk-Based Development Methods
- Implement Test Automation
- Continuous Delivery (CD)

### Architecture

- Use a Loosely Coupled Architecture

### Product and Process

- Gather and Implement Customer Feedback
- Make the Flow of Work Visible through the Value Stream
- Work in Small Batches
- Foster and Enable Team Experimentation

### Lean Management and Monitoring

- Have a Lightweight Change Approval Processes
- Monitor across Application and Infrastructure to Inform Business Decisions

### Cultural

- Support a Generative Culture
- Encourage and Support Learning
- Support and Facilitate Collaboration among Teams
- Provide Resources and Tools that Make Work Meaningful
- Support or Embody Transformational Leadership

## Four Key Metrics

- **Change Lead Time**
  - Time to implement, test, and deliver code for a feature
- **Deployment Frequency**
  - Number of deployments in a given duration of time
- **Change Failure Rate**
  - Percentage of failed changes over all changes (regardless of success)
- **Mean Time to Recovery**
  - Time it takes to restore service after production failure
