<!-- more -->

The book is divided into three parts: the disciplines, the standards, and the ethics.

The 1st part is the most technical one. It guides you with TDD examples, showing how testing can help you to design your code.

The 2nd part is about productivity, quality, and courage.

The 3rd part is about how did we get here in terms of people who develop software, and our responsibility within 
our ethics about do no harm, integrity, and teamwork.

One of my favourite parts from the book:

> Our software industry is wildly dynamic and changing; therefore, we must all be continuously aggressive learners.
> 
> How and when do you do this learning? If your employer provides you the time and space to do this kind of learning, then
take as much advantage of it as you can. If your employer is not helpful, then you'll have to learn on your own time.
>
> Be prepared to spend several hours per month on it. Make sure you have the personal time set aside for it.
>
> Yes, I know you have family obligations, bills to pay, planes to catch, and you've got a life. Okay, but you also have a
profession. And professions need care and maintenance. I expect us all to be continuous aggressive learners.

> `Chapter 11. Courage - Continuous Aggressive Learning`
