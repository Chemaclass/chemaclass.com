What is coupling, and why is it bad? What is decoupling, and how to do it efficiently? This book is a compilation of
strategies to decouple your domain code from those infrastructure details, so you can enjoy a healthier system in the
long run.

This book will teach you how to create [**PHPStan**](https://phpstan.org/) rules from no knowledge, and then it will 
guide you across many decoupling opportunities like, for example:
- web framework
- cli frameworks
- form validation
- orm and database
- test framework
