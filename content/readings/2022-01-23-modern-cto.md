> If I rest on past achievements, I'll never grow.

> LEVERAGE OTHERS' EXPERIENCE Books condense a lifetime of experience into a few hours' read. Powerful right?

> There are only two reasons you write bad code: 
> 
> 1)You know how to write good code, but you choose to write bad code. 
> 2)You don't know how to write good code. And both suck.

> As the CTO, you must have a business focus. 

> Always return to your core goals. [...] I make sure each core goal has a clearly defined "why?" behind it, this way 
> if I ever get lost, I go back to my "why."

-- Reference to "[Start with Why](/readings/start-with-why)" by Simon Sinek.

> When you're the boss, remember this golden rule: Ask people what they think instead of telling them what to do.

> If I can't asses the human component, I can't lead a team. [...] Team composition carries as much or perhaps even 
> greater weight than programming expertise.
 
> As CTO, if you can't explain value simply, it means you don't understand the business value behind your technology.
