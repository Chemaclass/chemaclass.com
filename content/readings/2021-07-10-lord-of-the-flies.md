Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the
apocalypse, Lord of the Flies has established itself as a true classic.

The book focuses on a group of British boys stranded on an uninhabited island, and their disastrous attempt to govern
themselves. Themes include the tension between groupthink and individuality, between rational and emotional reactions,
and between morality and immorality.
