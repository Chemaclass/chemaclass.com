Labeled a parable, an allegory, a myth, a morality tale, a parody, a political treatise, even a vision of the
apocalypse. It has established itself as a true classic.

The book focuses on a group of British boys stranded on an uninhabited island, and their disastrous attempt to govern
themselves. 

<!-- more -->

Themes include the tension between groupthink and individuality, between rational and emotional reactions,
and between morality and immorality.

The first chapters start slowly, but they are necessary to build up the context of the story, which scales pretty
quickly later on.
