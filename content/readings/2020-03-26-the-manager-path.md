## Key lessons

1. One-on-one meetings with your manager are an essential feature of a good working relationship.
2. A manager's job involves making it easy for her employees to get things done by creating fertile environments in
   which work can happen.
3. Mentoring new hires is critical.
4. Feedback works best when you, as a manager, pair that feedback with coaching.
5. It's unrealistic to think you can or should shield your team from everything.
