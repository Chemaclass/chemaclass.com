You might imagine that an effective leader is someone who makes quick, intelligent decisions, gives inspiring speeches,
and issues clear orders to their team, so they can execute a plan to achieve your organization's goals. Unfortunately,
that's an outdated model of leadership that just doesn't work anymore.

> Your words matter more than you think.

David gives six plays that all leaders should use to improve how their teams operate. He says a big problem with leaders
today is that they are trapped in an industrial-age playbook. In the industrial age leaders gave commands and employees
followed, and that was it. But that way of leading is no longer effective, it is outdated.

### The six plays

- Control the clock, don't obey the clock--Pre-plan decision points and give your people the tools they need to hit
  pause on a plan of action if they notice something wrong.
- Collaborate, don't coerce–As the leader, you should be the last one to offer your opinion.
- Commit, don't comply–Rather than expect your team to comply with specific directions, explain your overall goals, and
  get their commitment to achieving it one piece at a time.
- Complete, not continue–If every day feels like a repetition of the last, you're doing something wrong.
- Improve, don't prove–Ask your people to improve on plans and processes, rather than prove that they can meet fixed
  goals or deadlines.
- Connect, don't conform–Flatten hierarchies in your organization and connect with your people to encourage them to
  contribute to decision-making
