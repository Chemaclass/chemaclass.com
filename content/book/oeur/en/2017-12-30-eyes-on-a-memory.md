I used to have a personal WordPress blog. I wrote there mainly about my thoughts and feelings with the main motivation of reading them later and do some retrospectives in order to help me understand
myself a bit better. I started in January 2015, and by December 2017 I published a book with all these posts...
Even those that I didn't publish when I wrote them because they were too personal.

## "Eyes on a Memory", is the translation to English

It's my self-published book written in Spanish. Structured like a diary.
It's a compilation of all kinds of thoughts, as a result of moving to a new country and looking for new opportunities in life.

This project wasn't possible at all without the help of three friends:

- **Francisco Javier** and **Jesus Valera** helped me to express myself clearer.
- **Jes√∫s Robles** designed the cover and all the illustrations inside the book.

I published the book only in Spanish. I think it's time for the EN version.
