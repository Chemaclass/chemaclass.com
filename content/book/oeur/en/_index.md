## Eyes on a Memory (2015 - 2017)

I used to have a personal WordPress blog. There I wrote about my thoughts and feelings with the main 
motivation of reading them later and do some retrospectives in order to help me understand
myself a bit better. I started in January 2015, and by December 2017 I published a book with all these posts...
Even those that I didn't publish when I wrote them because they were too personal.
