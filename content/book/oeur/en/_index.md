## Eyes on a Memory

![book-cover-index](/images/book/oeur/oeur-cover.jpg)

I used to have a personal WordPress blog back in 2015. There I wrote about my thoughts and feelings with the main
motivation of reading them later and do some retrospectives to help me understand myself a bit better. I started in
January 2015, and by December 2017 I published a book with all these posts. Even those that I didn't publish when I
wrote them because they were too personal.
