## On-time

Is there anything more relative than time? A second, a minute, an hour, a day, a pause.

That moment… Like our first time in that thing that we dreamed of, like an encounter after so much time, like that result that we see with satisfaction after our efforts.

What is time? I see time like our tester. The one that teaches and corrects, the one that involves us directly in life. We could see it frequently as our enemy, like a liar with its absence, but I prefer to see it as a gift and outcome of our patient. We shouldn't have a reason to have it, yet, there it is, waiting for us.

Sometimes we just wish it would pass. Let's be us who face time. Against it and in its favor. Let's learn, let's adapt our sail to its wind.

How much time will it take us to learn to live? The answer is very simple: an entire life. Therefore, let's not be afraid to make mistakes, to enjoy each pause, every moment, any instant, all words, every second in which we are truly ourselves; to fight against our time.

## About being worried

A new day, a new reflection. For her my days, but above all, my nights.

Again, tired, shouldn't we? Of course, we should. Sometimes storms are coming, or at least that's what we think. We get used to anticipating problems, thinking they are already here and, without noticing, we find them before they start being. That's when the game begins when it should not.

Anticipating life is okay, but exaggerating these expectations can lead us to mistakes, to an incorrect interpretation of what is to come, just because we can never be sure of our assumptions. We must get closer, prepare ourselves for the future, but never be too sure of ourselves for the simple reason of being certain that something possible will “inevitably” happen. What a stupid idea though, thousands of things can happen until then! It was only something possible, let's not forget.

The turns that life gave and will give. The number of variables that reign our surroundings. The number of parameters, possibilities, opportunities… Those amounts are uncountable!

There are and should be preoccupations, of course. We must learn to have responsibilities and to worry about them. That's why I say: “Let's not allow inexistente ideas ruin even a second for us!” Let's anticipate as much as we want, but not get carried away by our negative emotions, the fruit of a preoccupation for something that still doesn't exist and might never exist. Not even a second wasted on unnecessary distractions.

We already have enough worries with the work-life requirements, to be worrying about situations or possible results.

Get up and face yourself, you can go for it all. Don't let a day be damaged by a false and sad illusion. Don't hurry when it's not necessary. Patience is one of the most tasteful virtues. We just need to give ourselves a little time to reflect. Everything will be okay.

## Each different path

Create, enjoy, imagine, think, dream, and cry for happiness if necessary. Express yourself and be yourself. Learn to be that, it's the most beautiful: improvise on and with life each different path.

What is our passion? What are we waiting for to make our day-to-day real? Is there anything more real than ourselves? I don't think so.

How many alternatives do we have? How many choices? How many possible paths? Which path will we choose for today? For what will you be remembered today? Today you can choose. Go out and breathe everything we deserve. Breathe as if there was no tomorrow, enjoy each breath, each sigh.

Each different path is there as if it was the last. It's one of the biggest things in our life: the ability to choose. Creating our path and enjoy doing it. Walking towards everything. Wherever we have to. Without stopping on our journey. Don't miss out on anything!

Dream and fight for it. Let's think that time is in our imagination as if it was an illusion… This is the most beautiful thing. Write for yourself. We are going to a safe port, I am sure.

We are here to show ourselves what do we worth. That is our biggest duty: beating ourselves. Let's create our path, something unique that no one could have ever imagined. Can you feel it? It's you!

## On the death

If you knew that you would die tomorrow, what would you do today? Would you go to someone? Who would you go to? What would you do on the last day of your life? Do you think you could do something significant? Write? Go out? Think? Sleep until everything happens?

What if tomorrow you found you have cancer? Would it change your life completely? What if you lost your mother tomorrow? Wouldn't it change anyway?

I am only afraid of what can slip through our fingers, of what doesn't depend on us. We shouldn't fear death itself, but the fact of not living the life we would have wanted to live. Let's fear what is necessary. Do not live in fear, but don't forget that she will always be lurking.

What have we done in our life? For what things will we be remembered? Will we be remembered? If you died tomorrow, do you think you could do something significant today? Stupid and fool if you did nothing in your life. Stop feeling sorry for yourself due to your lack of will, go out and seek your will to do! Let's fight death if necessary.

Let's leave foolishness once and for all, stop not believing in yourself! You are the only one that can fight against yourself!

You will win, that's what you're here for. Everything will be fine, as it cannot be any other way. You will make a superb life so that your last day is the least of your problems. And when that day comes – and be sure it will come – it will be the least of your problems. That day should not matter at all compared to all the other ones. 
That day will simply be the end of your huge phase as superman, of all that you have been. Beyond simple mortality. Beyond an idea or concept. You will be yourself. And then it shall be the day when you will be happiest because you will have lived.

Be proud when the day comes, and you look back and see everything you have created, as not everyone will be able to say the same. Let's be part of your grandeur, of yourself. Fight against all odds to someday become a [superman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cbermensch).
