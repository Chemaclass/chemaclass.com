## The art of writing

I like to write without thinking about anything. I’d like to read myself again someday: maybe it’ll help me to understand myself better…

I write to read it again. Could there be something more exciting than being able to talk to yourself and agree? Agreeing not only with the good stuff but also with the bad. Nevertheless, agreeing.

Writing is an art, where the only limits can be found in our language. And what about the beauty of being able to write in other languages? I hope to be able to do that soon. All these years learning languages for machines and I never thought of learning other languages for people, it was never my strong suit, I always thought. However, now in another country, I can ensure that it’s one of the most wonderful experiences a person can have.

Starting from the beginning to learn a new language: understanding it from its root, enjoying it, tasting each new word, each new expression.

Exciting as if it was a children's game. Writing is part of a language, writing is art. I want to read myself. I would like to be able to read myself with my eyes closed, the same way I can dream with my eyes open.

## Of a dream

I miss my family. Even though I’ll see them in less than 30 days, I am starting to think about seeing them twice a year. And, to be honest, it’s complicated. Being the eldest of our group makes one, without wanting to, have to be responsible. I need to be a role model.

After such a dark past, I am truly happy to not have fallen on any other path that wasn’t this one: my own. It’s not that it would have been easier. Nothing matters here but what there is: a young and happy dreamer, nostalgic and passionate.

I still wait eagerly to see more rain. Here, in the north of Germany, it is easier for me… I want to see more water falling.

Each day I wake up wanting to continue dreaming, to live with passion, and to smile with my nostalgia, hoping someday to come back and hug my family without setting aside the dream I am fighting for.

I hope to fulfill my goals: I want to move forward. “We are going to make it” is the phrase I repeat to myself the most and it makes me smile each day. Dreaming isn’t everything, but it’s the beginning of an entire life. Holding on to our dreams is the key to success.

We have to learn to move, to ask for help when necessary, and try not to stop until we make it. Life must teach us to educate ourselves. We must be our teachers: let’s focus only on the good examples.

## Doubts

We must create doubts, questions, and uncertainties because that’s the only way we will find answers. We just want to know more, want to discover new horizons, challenges, adventures, goals, dreams... The name doesn’t matter. With or without help, but let’s do it. Let’s ask ourselves each day. Never stop doing that!

Let’s not have faith in anything other than ourselves. Above a possible God and any other life form, this is our own. By luck or disgrace and until proven otherwise, our life is only one, this one. Let’s not waste it living in constant uncertainty nor life in which we can’t find enough joy.

Each doubt is there to be resolved. From doubt comes real knowledge and confidence. From doubt, we will be born.

Let’s doubt everything, but not live in constant doubt. Doubt as a philosophy, where we must learn to question before affirming. Doubt as a method: not flawless, but productive. Doubt to clarify, enjoying our decisions.

Let’s make mistakes, let’s choose! Let’s ask the world, our family, whomever we want but above all, ourselves.

Let’s question ourselves each day as if our life depends on it because it will. And, following the question, let’s give ourselves answers. Let’s contemplate different alternatives as well as their reasons. All the parameters are important. Let’s study each one’s origin.

Enjoy, because you’ll be learning to live. Make mistakes, learn, live!


## On the forefront

We should live more on the forefront and not so much on the back one.
Let’s reinvent ourselves, imagine yourself being what you think.

Who said fear? We should only be afraid of death, not life. Fear of death because it’s something that will come to all of us, luckily or not. It will be something we will all have to face once, twice, and more… until it’s our time. Until then, who said fear?

“We are nothing”, “we are insignificant”: how wrong those phrases are. We are the greatest. We must be so. Live on the forefront, on the first line, discovering ourselves, as well as our surroundings, so different to us. As if we lived in different realities.

We are the most real thing ever. We are unique and real. We are the reality at its finest. Each unit, as its match, make oneself a piece of art, a unique reality. We are, and that is what matters.

Interpreting out reality, learning to fight at the forefront, wanting to make progress each day. This is our goal: to shine. It’s enough to listen to a song, read a book, study something that makes us passionate, go out for a run, think about what motivates us… but let’s not live so much in the rearguard.

Let’s laugh and grow. We can give so much more of ourselves and each day is a new chance to demonstrate it. Let’s live at the forefront!

Let’s show ourselves just how wrong we were not too many years ago, and let’s fight in our reality to shine each day even more. Shine for the world. Shine for us.


## On the unexpected and necessary

It seems complicated. And it might be that way until it ends, to notice that it was simply something unexpected. A beautiful journey of experiences and emotions of every kind.

In the beginning, everything can seem so chaotic, strange, and confusing… But it’s nothing more than something unexpected. It has been a rich experience. Let’s not stay alone at home, the isolation will not help us; let’s go out for a walk, the fresh air will clear our minds.

The world is full of unexpected opportunities. We should count life by moments, by those sudden occasions that end up being significant. Our life’s worth is made of the expected moments, as well as the unexpected ones. Both remain so necessary.

Just thinking of it gives me a sensation of sweetness, as if it was a gift for no reason. Let’s deserve this gift, then. Let’s fight to deserve this unexpected and necessary thing in life. Let’s make ourselves deserving of each gift. Let’s take our time, always. But don't forget that these unexpected will never stop being there.
