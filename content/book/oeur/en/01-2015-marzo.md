## In one drink

It is funny to go hand in hand with the time,first feeling so many things, so many emotions concentrated in an instant and second, without meaning the same type of emotions.

I try not to fall, but it’s impossible: sooner or later, you end up rushing yourself; one way or another, we all must fall.
And I will not talk about getting up, not this time. I will talk about understanding the reason. Ourselves.

Beyond overcoming things, there is the understanding of the reason. What failed? Why did it fail? It is not a matter of finding someone to blame, but to find solutions. Even before doing that, one has to search for the true reason. Do you think there is none?

I do not believe in destiny. I do not believe in anything else than the value of each person.

It is impossible to know everything, and we should not want to. We need to learn how to delegate responsibilities without ever forgetting our own.
We must comprehend ourselves, understand ourselves, be realistic, never lose focus of ourselves, and not dream in excess. Not overdoing anything, in the end.

“Don’t miss out on anything. Enjoy, but don’t drink life in a single sip.”
This was one of the most valuable pieces of advice my uncles gave me before I parted on this journey.

Understanding, pursuit, comprehension. It is never useless to talk to yourself to organize your thoughts and stop them from bringing you down.

Everything should be born from passion and sanity. Because all passion has a minimum sincerity, and sanity is what allows passion to remain alive.

Everything should be born from sincerity and the desire’s passion.


## For music

Cold… a bit, but not enough to stop thinking.

Constant reforms, agitated and fun. As if it was a game, the most real we could play. I raise the volume, breathe and direct my stare to myself. I don’t see myself. I look for myself, but it’s not me who finds me, but her. I raise the volume.

I can’t recognize myself, how long has it been? When was the last time we played blithely on the streets? I can’t remember anymore…

For her, the music that accompanied me on the rainy days, the sunny ones, the ones filled with tears, and the ones with joy. The soundtrack of the life, of our lives
When was the last time we thanked her for her company?

That company that listens to us and tucks us in, even at the coldest nights. Naked or dressed, In bed or on a walk. All of her.
Listen to her, and you will not be able to escape her charm. We have to learn to smile and live in love, but above all, we need to learn to listen.

She is the one who writes. Profound, rebellious, furious, relaxed. In constant evolution, with eagerness to overcome herself. We can find her organized, chaotic, with a smile, with her arms open, and with the intention to hold us and not let us go.

Learn to listen, learn from her, and with her.


## The art of learning

Daydreaming. Remembering. Thinking about everything that has changed, what will change, what arouses each day, in each proposal we make ourselves, in each breath.

Get sick, and sick with life. Thinking in the dark. Imagining a dreamy future. A future that even in our childhood we feared of being too good, an impossible future.

Just talk. Try it as good as you can; no one is born knowing how to talk. Learn how to talk. Conquer yourself. Get up each day as if it was the last. Some days just pass, and when they do, we don’t realize they happened. Don’t allow that. Fall in love with your life: with your future; as you learn to distinguish your reality, to see and understand your surroundings and your ecosystem.

Listen to the sun, it’s a reason for joy. Move, give yourself a few minutes a day. Play with life. Enjoy your growth more and more. Challenge yourself like never before and show yourself just how wrong you were not too long ago. Compare yourself, always with yourself first. Say yes to everything that you can and will, but do not forget to say no.

Cheer yourself up! Cheer yourself in a way you never have! Grow, dream, live, be. You’re all art, and your lifestyle depends only on you. It’s your attitude that will determine your quality of life.

Write if it’s necessary; if not, just listen to your thoughts. We must organize them frequently, or they will rust. Enjoy it. Enjoy yourself. You are everything, and the biggest thing you have. Care for it in a way you never would have imagined years ago.

You are all art. Form yourself, be patient and when you least expect it, you’ll be talking.

Cheer yourself up in a way you never have! Dare to smile while learning.


## We are a reflection

Who are we really? What do we do each day? Where is the echo of our actions? What is each instant’s goal? Are few of the most exciting questions we can ask ourselves and that almost made me lose my mind back in the day.

We are a reflection of ourselves. We couldn't be anything else. Each day is a new opportunity to do everything we still haven’t done and to repeat everything with which we feel complete: our thoughts, crazes, goals, our own journey.

We must transmit to the world everything we want to feel from life. We are our hope and chance. What we do will have an echo, not in eternity, but in our tomorrow.
When we get up each day and look at the world in the eye, with a hopeful glance, it will respond. It will be our reflection, as we are the world.

Each instant is vital. Each decision made each glance. For our life. To understand the final sense. To understand ourselves.

It’s pointless to smile without a reason, but don’t we have plenty of reasons? Let’s take care of our own reasons. It’s our biggest task: to smile with reason. Let’s rise higher than ever, let’s learn to fly, to dream, to not settle.

Let’s give ourselves a reflection, a glance, a breath, a “cheer”!

Let’s reflect who we want to be. Let’s be unique and essential to ourselves, different, original, unpredictable.
Let’s be bright and never stop shining. Let’s fall in love with our image, as we are its reflection.
