It's my self-published book written in Spanish. Structured like a diary.
It's a compilation of all kinds of thoughts as a result of moving to a new country and looking for new opportunities in life.

This project wasn't possible at all without the help of three friends:

- **Francisco Javier** and **Jesus Valera** helped me to express myself clearer.
- **Jesús Robles** designed the cover and all the illustrations inside the book.

I published the book only in Spanish. I think it's time for the EN version.

To my uncles, who provided my siblings and me with constant support for many years.
