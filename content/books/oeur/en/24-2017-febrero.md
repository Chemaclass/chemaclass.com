## Our Life

The sensation of losing everything can naturally mislead us when we fully understand our reality. What does it mean to have lost everything?

It is our context that determines the perception of what we are judging. Playing, in turn, a role that is more than important, though not definitively explicit.

Consider not expressing ourselves, not revealing ourselves to ourselves, for an excessive period. Weigh the idea of not considering our observation of what we cannot stop looking at: our life and our time, our moments and our being: ourselves.

Not reflecting on our actions in the wake of our leaving —even if involuntarily— sentences our opinion and appreciation of everything that borders our surroundings. Everything we do, therefore, will leave a trace: our immortal past, which is inevitably part of the cause, directly transforming us into the consequence we are becoming.

For the estimation of our values, we will arbitrate their resolution. Encircling our sanity and specifying what our disposition dictates. If we do not value ourselves, our values will be diminished in the possible shyness of cowardice. We cannot be upright or free individuals if we do not value ourselves. Otherwise, at least we will have the opportunity to be so to the extent of our possible considerations.

```
I refer to forgetting ourselves:
to our forgetting in the mornings when we wake up,
to our forgetting in every moment,
to our forgetting at night when we go to bed.
```
What is it to have lost everything when we still have the confusion of uncertainty to discover? Or to enjoy.

Reflecting is a way to address the daily dissatisfaction of emotional emptiness, not just as a random habit without responsibilities or expected outcomes, because who would ultimately care...?

Let us not stop meditating, observing, diagnosing our impressions, enjoying reflecting, and resolving our sensations to better appreciate everything that deserves our attention and understanding and our commitment: our life.

## Habits

Reflecting as a method, as a solution to the daily dissatisfaction of lack of feelings. Routine for our being, skill for our experience.

Habits that define us determine us and even limit us in our possible dissatisfaction, from our basic instincts through simple reflexes to the most complex ones that seem unwilling to be tamed.

We are unconscious habits that we should consciously learn to understand and accept to overcome and improve because any habit that has never been questioned can never be overcome.

Skill as desire, as the practice of our mastery: trial and error to later inevitably acquire wisdom.

Where did our daily habits go? Knowledge is power. And power will allow us to choose what we truly want for ourselves. Being aware of our routines and their reasons will allow us to choose and be responsible for our actions.

Exercise our custom, our praxis. Feel useful in our reconciled dream, prudent with our judgment, and consistent with our maturity in the face of what is truly serious.

Study of our behavior, attempts, responses, observation, and empiricism beyond mere theory: pragmatism for and with us in our daily lives. Because words are superfluous when actions speak for themselves.
