## Truth

Truth resides in knowledge. And knowledge will always depend on the context. Knowing the truth is basically establishing a connection between the context and the knowledge one intends to assert as truth.

In a context where knowledge can only be acquired empirically, what is truth if not the subjective assertion? In this non-theoretical context, what is truth, if not a partial manifestation of understanding?

Our ability to accurately discern the truth of subjective evidence is so individual and personal that it is hard to believe we can truly reach an ideal truth globally.

We could say that truth represents our contextual state in our minds, our knowledge.

As we grow, our truths take shape; assertions seem (and should) be questioned, evidence needs stronger foundations, and our confidence in what we defend as truth must be certified. Otherwise, the pillars will fall in no time because there are not many claims we can assure as absolute, like our time and death.

Growing up should teach us the meaning of truth, starting with the sense of life, the importance of our moments, and our reflection toward others and ourselves. This means that maturity is only a matter of what we are doing with our knowledge to understand better our context and what we are doing in our environment to expand our wisdom.

Everything in this life depends on us. Even the truth, especially considering that it could change over time. And by "us," I mean our entity in its isolated context.

Therefore, it will be our unique projection that will delineate our truths.

## Without an End

Stories that accompany. Years of recorded discourse. A book born from ideas and sketches without a near end that, nevertheless, must end, as everything that begins must.

Endings don't necessarily have to be sad, although our feelings may sometimes think otherwise. Time is the only responsible party, just as memory is the one that fights against forgetting.

Memories bring us closer to knowledge in the form of experience. Energetic virtuosity is a daily activity, not satisfied with mere subsistence.

Externalizing internal communication with apparent ease. It was well said: "All that glitters is not gold." I was trying to be consistent.

It was an exercise in logical and personal cleansing, emphasizing everything where I could express myself openly, with, why not say it, specific fears at the beginning for not knowing how to start. Stop fearing being wrong by thinking too much before and after acting.

Embark on a journey not to finish it, but for the journey and all that, it entails the birth of a beginning without necessarily knowing an end, without having to expire if care was taken.

Let's learn to be like the person we truly wish to meet tomorrow. And all endings will evolve into beginnings.
