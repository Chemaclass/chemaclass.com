## The Value

```
"How much are we worth?" I wondered.
"How much are you worth?" it answered.
```
What will truly define the value of values?
```
Courage,
effort,
effectiveness,
courage,
esteem,
merit,
boldness,
interest,
```
As well as the importance of each of our moments.

Experiences, habits, excursions, journeys..., the small achievements that contribute to helping us thrive in our short, medium, and long-term goals. Verify, try, study, and examine reality firsthand!

What can be more valuable than the very habit of our conquest, from and towards ourselves? Nothing!

The habit of our conquest should be focused—with maximum priority—on ourselves!
