## Older brother

We have to want to be the older brother we would have liked to have. We have to be everything we wanted to be yesterday so that tomorrow we can be that. We need references, more so when it’s about making way. I wish I had an older brother to look up to, learn from him, and help myself with him by my side.

It was complicated, but it was no use to live to hide, day after day. I saw myself forced to go out, to observe, to grow, to fight. I really would have liked to have one, especially at those moments that got to be so complex and complicated. My main reason is to be a role model to my siblings so that they do not have to throw the same things I had to throw.

I want to be that older brother that I would have liked to have. That role model I would have wanted to follow. That one I would have liked to admire. Especially at hard times, helping to avoid that any of my brothers and sisters feel that way, as it is not only about us, but about what they make of us. To help us make our way, to help us, to give a hand.

## The 22’s end

Today is my last day as a twenty-two-year-old; tomorrow, I'll be starting to be twenty-three. And it is today that I am completing my twenty-two, twenty-two complete years. Starting tomorrow, I'll start living my twenty-three. People celebrate on the day of their birthdays that they have completed the phase that just ended. In standard terms, I should "celebrate" that I already reached twenty-two. However, I prefer the idea of celebrating that I got the next phase and that I still have all this time ahead of me to enjoy. Not my twenty-twos; my twenty-three. My twenty-twos have already been lived. Now I want more.

It is true that now I will be living with twenty-two years, reason enough for joy, but I am more motivated by the idea that I still am, which is what's important.

I have never felt as alive and young as now, and I hope that I can aim for more with time. Younger and more active. I feel like having birthdays is rejuvenating. Having birthdays is more than the idea; it's everything that comes with them.

Anyhow, today is the day I complete my twenty-two years, and tomorrow I begin my twenty-third. If you're reading this, I appreciate it in advance and with a smile in congratulations. The only thing I ask in exchange is for you to smile back. So do it because it's never too late to smile.

## Solitude

I enjoy having company at its most, but I also appreciate its absence. I love to be surrounded by people, but I also need a moment for myself. When I am always busy, I even start to miss myself. Those moments of solitude in which I talk to myself without giving anyone excuses other than myself—those moments of putting in order, reflection, listening, and silence. Usually, with music accompanying me in the background. Smiling music, like me.

Notes, as well as ideas that shout endlessly, to the rhythm of memories, ambitions, desires, and the future. Those moments of analysis, of recreation and uncertainties, as well as of inspiration. Of wanting to do everything and eagerness to do so.

Dreams and emotions that still must wait. Enjoying a song, as well as its meaning. Without lyrics, the lyrics will be created by all those thoughts that she will make us remember. All while losing track of time, forgetting everything, and remembering nothing—focusing all our attention on the music's rhythm, evading everything that could worry us.

To play to write, disconnect, and connect again. To worry and stop worrying. It's our minute. Let's give ourselves a breath. Nothing will happen on its own, but it's also not a mystery from another world. You simply have to make it happen. Waiting with our arms crossed is of no use. It has never been helpful. That's why it's not about wanting to dream but about doing. Here we are to do everything we can and always a little more.

Solitary sometimes, but not alone.

## There are

Some lament themselves, and others live.

Some live in constant fear of life, and others dare to confront it.

Some only consume their time, and others fight in their realities.

Some don't realize the real value they're throwing away, and others enjoy small details.

Some don't dare to dream, and others who desire.

Some have nothing, and others are courageous, uncomplicated, and full of life.

Some lack sense, and not precisely because of those who do have it.

Some waste their potential on excuses that not even they can believe. And others who take advantage of all their potential to change themselves and, in that way, change the world.

There are, and there will be, as there always should be a bit of everything: that's the way it is in our nature. The only difference will be: who will we be? Who do we want to be?

Some find it impossible to smile when they wake up, and others go to sleep with a smile.

There are those we wish not to see all day long and those we constantly need by our side.

Some emit negative energy just through their stare, and those that, when you see them, you can't avoid smiling innocently due to the joy they share.

There are, and there will be, because it's in our nature. There will always be a bit of everything, but the question will then be: who will you be?

## To create

One of the reasons why I love my job is because of the simple fact that I can create something out of nothing, and I think that it will be a feeling is shared in many other professions.

I like what I do, to feel free within it. To feel accomplished is fundamental in our routine. To create solutions, solve problems, create new challenges, and reach our goals should be our main job.

I am getting up each day with the excitement to create, write down each idea, madness, possible solution, each try in the end. To progress creating and daydreaming. To make all those ideas that once were born from an illusion.

To establish new challenges, to create more and more. To demonstrate to ourselves the responsibility boundaries of our imagination, proving this way our enormous power and its responsibility. To give something to the world, innovating, showing, and not just talking.

To reveal all that we can create. To prosper in the world, making. These are the reasons why we should love our work.
