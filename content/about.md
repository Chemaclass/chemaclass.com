# About

## Who is Chema?

I just love what I do: Software Development. Especially algorithm designing, and resolution of logic problems.

In love with SOLID code and agile methodologies. I believe that clean code, testing, and refactoring are the best tools
for every developer to achieve quality.

> Never stop learning!

## Why "Chema"?

In Spain (where I come from) this is pretty common:

- Jose Maria === Chema
- Jose Manuel === Chema
- Jose Miguel === Chemi
- Jose !== Che

## Why "Chemaclass"?

In 2011, I started learning Java and at the same time I needed a nickname. So I came up with "Chema.class"
(a `java` generates a `.class` file after its "compilation"). In the end I removed the dot separation for simplicity.
