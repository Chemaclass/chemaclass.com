## Who is Chema?

I consider myself a competitive, sociable, and reliable person. 
I just love what I do: Software Development.
I especially enjoy algorithm designing, software engineering, and resolution of logic problems.

In love with SOLID code and Agile methodologies.
I believe that clean code, testing, and refactoring are the best tools for every developer to achieve quality.

> My motto: A piece of code should transmit what's going on without its language "syntax knowledge".

Never stop learning!

## Why "Chema"?

In Spain (where I come from) this is pretty common: 
- Jose Maria === Chema
- Jose Manuel === Chema
- Jose Miguel === Chemi
- Jose !== Che

## Why "class"?

In 2011, I needed a nickname, at the same time I started learning with Java. It was 2011. 
I wanted something unique, and I really liked Java, so I decided to have a nickname 
as "Chema.class" (a "compiled" `.java` file into bytecode ends up into a `.class` file).
In the end I remove the dot separation for simplicity.
