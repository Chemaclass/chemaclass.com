## Jose Maria Valera Reales (Chema)

My name is Jose Maria Valera Reales, but everyone knows me by Chema. 
I live in Berlin since 2015, and I love good software, music, reading, and sport.

I am a Software developer at [Teufel Audio](http://teufel.de) & [Phel-lang](http://phel-lang.org).

I love writing about stuff that I find interesting and bring some value to my life, so I can share them with you.
