I enjoy writing about topics that I find exciting and bring some value to my life. That's why I created my [tech blog](https://chemaclass.com/blog/) and my [readings blog](https://chemaclass.com/readings/). There, I write a monthly post about tech, habits, and team behaviors, among other areas. You can also explore my [projects](https://chemaclass.com/projects/) and [talks](https://chemaclass.com/talks/).
